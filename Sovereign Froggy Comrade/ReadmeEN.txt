The game was created within three weeks as a first-semester game programming assignment at SAE.
The assets were taken from the Unity Store (Pixel Adventure 1 and Pixel Adventure 2) and from opengameart.org (Michele "Buch" Bucelli, Golden UI).
The evaluation focused primarily on code readability, best practices, and general C# fundamentals.
No AI was used at any stage of the project.
