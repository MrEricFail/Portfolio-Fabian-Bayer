The game was created within 48 hours while participating in the SAE GameJam in June 2025.
The assets were created by our team's artists, and the music was generated using AI under the supervision of Vladislav.
I was responsible for the pickups in C++ and the main menu. Nico for the character and the in-game pause menu. Vladislav was responsible for the direction, support, and the music.
